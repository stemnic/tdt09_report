\section{Introduction}

In this report we are going to look at the possibility to virtualize the xv6 operating system on a riscv architecture. What functionality need to be changed if any in the kernel code itself and the underlining architecture needed to enable this functionality. There are already many complex virtualization solutions available today both open source and closed commercial ones. The purpose of this paper is not to replicate any of the modern work but rather go back to the roots of virtualization while operating systems and computers was simpler.

The inspiration of this report was Unix as an Application Program \cite{Golubunix} from 1990 which focuses on how one could “virtualize” the Unix operating system by abstracting the unix kernel to run ontop of Mach microkernel
